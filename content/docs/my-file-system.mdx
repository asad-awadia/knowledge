title: My file system
---

Explained my setup in old wiki page [here](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/unix/my-file-system).

But in rough it looks like this: (as output from [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza))

## ~/src

```
alfred   c       deno  elixir  help    lean  moonbit    nix    odin  other  py       rust   snippets  ts  zig
browser  config  do    go      kotlin  mojo  nikiv.dev  ocaml  org   pause  raycast  scala  swift     ui
```

Majority of `~/src` is open source and is shared and explained in [GitHub bio](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev#src)
