## January 7

2025 is exciting year in all things. It is also the year I set out to do weekly public logs which look like this in [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things) as recurring task.

Year is starting off slow but there are concrete things I need to do, one of them is to release [SolBond](https://github.com/solbond/solbond).

Also I actually [published this new docs/wiki site](https://x.com/nikitavoloboev/status/1876279218763674056).

[Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net) is big inspiration in how much he and how he shares his work/learnings. And [brandur](https://brandur.org) is big inspiration for how to do long form writing well.

Got sick with hard cough and fever so couldn't work on anything.

Tried to make sense of [OpenAuth](https://openauth.js.org) & [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com) as I try to move away from using [Clerk](https://clerk.com) for all things auth.

Still coughing but at least no fever. Not sure why cough is not going away.

I am super financially broke and stressed out. None of the projects I ever worked on have made any money.

I am thinking of selling learn-anything.xyz and all other things and maybe at least getting some money. I can probably get 100$ for it which is more than what I have now.

Can use it for cough medicine.
